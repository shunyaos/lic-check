lic-check
=============
A command line tool which lists the licenses of all packages in dependencies.txt in a Debian-based system.

This is a fork of the [dpkg-licenses](https://github.com/daald/dpkg-licenses) project. And the script is modified to read packages from a `dependencies.txt` file  instead of getting all the packages installed in the system.
